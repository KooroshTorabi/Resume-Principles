# Resume Principles : 

1.  Personal picture : it is better not to have the picture in Resume
    
2.  Having Hard Numbers (specefic numbers) in resume, speak quantitative instead of the quality.  
    For example :  
    from : Improved our Web Core Vitals metrics.  
    To : Boosted Web Core Vitals metrics by an impressive 18%, enhancing user experience with smoother interactions.  
    Notice how using hard numbers **emphasizes the impact of your work**  
    - this is what recruiters look for on your resume
    
3.  change repetitive action verbs
    
4.  avoid from simple verbs, use strong verbs instead  
    samples :  
    In Change Of, _use_  Sprearheaded, Managed, or Drove  
    Organized, _use_  Catalogued, Executed, Monitored, or Operated  
    Responsible For, _use_  Pioneered, Established, or Initiated  
    Was, _use_ Developed, Prepared, or Improved
    
    Worked, _use_ Prepared, Developed, or Implemented
    
5.  Avoid Typo or not-related words  
    This is considered to represent your carelessness and shows that you did not leave enough time for your resume. Be very careful
    
6.  Use achievement-oriented verbs instead of responsibility-oriented ones  
    example :  
    _from_ :  
    Responsible for the coordinated management of multiple projects directed toward strategic business and other organizational objectives  
    _To_ :  
    Managed a **5-member** cross-functional (product, engineering, sales, support) team and coordinated with **six business partners** toward the successful launch of an e-commerce platform.
    
7.  Size of Resume  
    maximum 2 pages, 1 page is better , and overall 850 words (between 450 and 850 words long)
    
8.  Brief and useful (precised)  
    speak about yourself more than your companies
    
9.  Number of Bullet points : between 12 and 32
    
10.  size of Bullet Points : maximum 2 sentences or lines
    
11.  Speaking quantity instead of general words
    
12.  Do not use clichés Buzzwords, should be considered removing  
    for example :  
    _passionate_, _team player_, _self motivated_  
      
    
13.  The dates should be sorted in descending order (the first one is the last place you worked, and so on to the first place you worked, which is the oldest).
    
14.  Do not have a Gap
    
15.  Do not have an Overlap
    
16.  Contact info : Phone number, Email, Linkedin, Portfolio
    
17.  Do not mention about Marriage status, Age, military service, nationality, gender, religion
    
18.  Name of Resume File : Kourosh-TorabiJafroudi-v1.0.pdf
    
19.  Remove any personal pronouns from your resume
    
20.  use active verbs instead of passive verb
    
21.  Possible inconsistent punctuation :  
    Some of your bullet points end with periods and some don't. It's important to choose one for your bullet points, and stick to it throughout your resume.

    If you use any paragraphs in your resume, make sure you always end them with periods.
    
    It's better to have all the bullet points sentences ends with Dot
    
22.  Use Heading format for your resume to read better for ATS, you can use Google Drive Temples to sure these headings to be considered.
    
23.  Experience is First then Education
    
    It's your most recent and relevant experience, and thus should be the first thing hiring managers should see.
    
24.  Summery  
    “Paragraph at top of resume” can be detected by resume screeners. One paragraph only.  
    Example :  
    _Spearheaded the delivery of engineering solutions for web, mobile, and native applications, leveraging ReactJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB, resulting in +25 successful projects and over 16 years of proven success in exceeding client expectations and driving revenue growth._
    
25.  Add more metrics and numbers  
    Recruiters want to see hard numbers in your summary section. Good resume summaries contain at least two. For example, you can mention the size of the project you worked on ($), number of people you worked with, or any other metrics relevant to your industry. Detailed examples and templates are provided below.
    
26.  No unnecessary sections:  
     - Do not insert Interests or References  
    Resume standards have changed over the last decade. Some sections have become less useful to hiring managers and including them wastes space, and may tell hiring managers that you're out of touch with professional standards.
     - No references section
    you shouldn't include a references section in your resume. Employers will ask you directly if they ever need to contact your references.
     - No objective
    While you can include a short summary on your resume, do not include an objective in your resume. It is clear to hiring managers that you are looking for a job there's no need to restate it at the top of your resume.
    
27.  Skills – hard skills
    
28.  Mention Soft Skills in bullet points indirectly
    
29.  Two sections for Hard Skills : Skills(current), prior stacks
    
30.  Versioning resumes, use excel sheets to remember which resume sent to which companies
